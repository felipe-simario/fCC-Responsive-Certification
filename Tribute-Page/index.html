          <li><span class="age">1947</span> - Indian Independence: Gandhi's campaign for peaceful resistance led to the British withdrawal and India's independence.</li>
          <li><span class="age">1948</span> - Gandhi's Assassination: He was assassinated by an extremist, but his legacy of nonviolent resistance endures to this day.</li>
        </ul>
